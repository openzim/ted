TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is a global set of conferences under the slogan "ideas worth spreading". They address a wide range of topics within the research and practice of science and culture, often through storytelling. The speakers are given a maximum of 18 minutes to present their ideas in the most innovative and engaging ways they can. One can eaisly find all the TED videos [here](https://ted.com/talks).

This project is aimed at creating a sustainable solution to make TED accessible offline by creating ZIM files providing these videos in a similar manner like online.


## Getting started :rocket:

#### Install the dependencies
Make sure that you have `python3`, `unzip`, `ffmpeg`, `wget` and `curl` installed on your system before running the scraper (otherwise you'll get a warning to install them).

#### Setup the package
One can eaisly install the PyPI version but let's setup the source version. Firstly, clone this repository and install the package as given below.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python3 setup.py install
```

That's it. You can now run `ted2zim` from your terminal

```bash
ted2zim --topics [TOPICS] --name [NAME]
```

For the full list of arguments, see [this](ted2zim/entrypoint.py) file or run the following
```bash
ted2zim --help
```

Example usage
```bash
ted2zim --topics="augmented reality" --debug --name="augumented_reality" --format=mp4 --title="Augmented Reality" --description="TED videos in AR category" --creator="TED" --publisher="openzim" --output="output" --keep --low-quality
```

This project can also be run with docker. Use the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) to run it with docker. See steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/).

## Features :robot:
You can create ZIMs for multiple topics (should be same as given [here](https://ted.com/talks)), choose between different video formats (webm/mp4), different compression rates, and even use an S3 based cache.

#### Want more flexibility? There's a multitool
`ted2zim-multi` is an extra command available that allows you to do much more with the scraper. It falls back to `ted2zim` if normal commands are passed. It supports creation of multiple ZIMs with single command for both playlists and topics and even getting metadata from a specified JSON file. It supports the following extra arguments -

- `--indiv-zims` - Allows you to create one zim/topic or one zim/playlist
- `--{name|description|zim-file|title}-format` - Allows you to add custom format for the equivalent `ted2zim` arguments. You can add `{identity}` as a placeholder in these values to get the playlist ID / topic name in it's place (spaces replaced by `-`). You can now also add `{slug}` to get the topic/playlist slug.
- `--metadata-from` - Path to a JSON file containing the metadata.

Should be of the following format:

```bash
{
    "<playlist-id/topic-name-with-underscores>": {
        "name": "sample_name_{identity}",
        "description": "Sample description",
        "title": "Custom title",
        "zim-file": "sample.zim",
        "tags": "tag",
        "creator": "Yourself",
        "build-dir": "/custom_build_dir"
    }
}
```

See `ted2zim-multi --help` for details.
